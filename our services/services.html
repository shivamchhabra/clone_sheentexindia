            <p>
              Fabric selection is a crucial step in designing a project because
              fabrics are designed for specific applications, a fabric
              manufactured for one purpose, may not be adaptable for another
              use. Therefore selecting the appropriate fabric is only the first
              step in providing serviceable fabrics for apparel manufacturing.
              Designers specify the fabric as part of their design concept.
              Designers may develop new styles for fabrics that have been
              successful.

              An inspection is an activity such as measuring, examining, testing
              or gauging one or more characteristics of a product and comparing
              the results with specified requirements in order to establish
              whether conformity is achieved for each characteristic. The term
              inspection refers to the activity of checking products, whereas
              audit applies to analyzing manufacturing processes and/or systems.
              The quality inspector usually follows a pre-established checklist
              that is based on the product specifications.

              Manufacturing is the creation and assembly of components and

              finished goods by using tools. Production is similar but broader:

            <img src="weaving.jpg" alt="img" />
            <p>
              Weaving is a method of textile production in which two distinct
              sets of yarns or threads are interlaced at right angles to form a
              fabric or cloth. Other methods are knitting, crocheting, felting,
              and braiding or plaiting. The longitudinal threads are called the
              warp and the lateral threads are the weft or filling.

            <p>
              Tufting is a type of textile weaving in which a thread is inserted
              on a primary base. It is an ancient technique for making warm
              garments, especially mittens. After the knitting is done, short
              U-shaped loops of extra yarn are introduced through the fabric
              from the outside so that their ends point inwards.

            <p>
              During cutting the marker is applied to top ply of lay. The
              objective of cutting is to separate fabric parts and replicas of
              pattern pieces in the marker plan. By accurate cutting we can
              minimize the fabric wastage and without fabric cutting it is
              impossible to get uniform finished fabric to prepare the pattern
              pieces for proper sewing.

              In the textile arts, a stitch is a single turn or loop of thread,
              or yarn. Stitches are the fundamental elements of sewing,
              knitting, embroidery, crochet, and needle lace-making, whether by
              hand or machine. A variety of stitches, each with one or more
              names, are used for specific purposes.

              agents or solvents. The latex is protected with antioxidants to
              ensure that its properties last for a long time, and it is very
              resistant to degradation during use.

              A metal detector is an electronic instrument that detects the

              metal inclusions hidden within objects, or metal objects buried
              underground. They often consist of a handheld unit with a sensor
              probe which can be swept over the ground or other objects.
